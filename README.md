# Welcome to our Finance Sentiment Analysis project
### Matilde Bernocchi, Francesco D'aleo and Elena Ginebra

Our approach to this challenge involved the use of a Random Forest classifier, 
a choice motivated by its robustness and efficacy in handling diverse datasets. 
We meticulously prepared our dataset, which comprised financial news articles and reports, labeling them based on their sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

#### We use Streamlit for doing the FrontEnd and deploy the app

#### The user can play we the app and scrape the news of the day of Yahoo Finance and the app will return the percentage of good, bad and neutral news.
